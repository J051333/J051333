I'm a full-stack developer with ten passionate years of coding behind me

I'm currently working on The Epic of Nalia, a video game.

I'm currently collaborating on The Epic of Nalia with [Ton](https://github.com/t0ntr4n) and [SleepingMage](https://github.com/SleepingMage)!

I'm reachable through Instagram DMs!

I run an i5-12500H and a 3050 Ti with 32GB of DDR4 3200MHz RAM. I run Windows 11, but I love Linux and use a Kali VM.
