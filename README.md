Pronouns: She/they

I love coding, I'm driven by an endless curiosity and have to know how things work. Currently a junior (it's weird) in Uni for my B.S. in Comp Sci. I love cats and music, and play the flute and the oboe. 

DM me on Instagram!

Currently working on Estro-Tracker with my super cool sibling [Sa9m](https://github.com/intentionalDisaster99)!

I run an i5-12500H and a 3050 Ti with 32GB of DDR4 3200MHz RAM. I run Windows 11 (though often wish I didn't) and have some experience with Linux.

I've been fascinated with programming since the third grade, which in my head is a long time. I started with JavaScript during my free time in school with [CodeCademy](https://codecademy.com). A few `console.log`'s here and some text-based RPG's there. In fourth grade, I took a Udemy course on SQL with my dad. 

In fifth grade, I picked up a Udemy course on C++, and this was the first time I took coding seriously. I learned a ton and have known that's what I wanted to do ever since. In high school, I took a year of engineering before I swapped over to the computer science academy and took three years of AP and dual enrollment coding classes (and participated in some networking/IT fundamentals) and got certified in Java, JS and HTML, and Software Development in C#. I graduated in 2023 and now I'm attending a univeristy for computer science. Woohoo now you know my life story (ish)!
